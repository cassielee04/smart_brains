# DS598 DL4DS Final Project Smart Brains

## Introduction

The project focuses on enhancing the detection of brain tumors in medical image databases through automated segmentation and classification.
Leveraging deep convolutional neural networks with multiscale feature extraction, this approach aims to efficiently identify discriminant texture features of various tumor types.
By integrating multiscale receptive fields, it captures essential local and contextual information within the images. 
 The goal is to improve MRI's effectiveness as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, facilitating more accurate diagnosis, growth prediction, and treatment of brain tumors, underscoring the importance of automation in medical diagnostics.
